Blockchain is one component of the technology infrastructure of Bitcoin the system.
One component, not the most important component, not the most revolutionary component. In fact that technology pre-existed. In fact most of the technologies used in Bitcoin pre-existed. Hashes, hash trees, cryptography, public key cryptography, digital signatures, proof of work. All of these things existed before Bitcoin.
The invention is to take all of these things together and leverage proof of work as a mechanism for consensus that allows us to control a blockchain in a decentralized manner when no one has
cultivate control over it.
Can you build a consensus algorithm different than proof of work? Yes.
Can you build a blockchain that is not decentralized and doesn't use proof-of-work? Yes.

Blockchain is not the most interesting technology in Bitcoin and this is often misunderstood.
Blockchain is like the transmission in your car. Very important. Absolutely necessary to keep moving.
But no one said:
"Oh finally! With the invention of the internal combustion engine in the automobile, we now have the ability to build transmission based vehicles."
Nobody said: "I like cars but I'm more interested in the technology behind cars. Transmissions."
In the blockchain space a lot of people make the statements: "Well bitcoin is interesting, but..." BUT's means I haven't understood it yet.
Bitcoin is interesting, but I'm more interested in the technology behind Bitcoin. Blockchain.

"These newfangled automobiles are interesting, but I'm more interested in the revolutionary technology behind automobiles. Pneumatic inflatable tires.
If we could combine pneumatic inflatable tires with the steady traditional propulsion mechanism of horses, we could really do somethinginteresting!"
